# HackDavis2024

Check out our [DevPost!](https://devpost.com/software/ecoradius?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)
## Setup:
For now, we have not deployed the Django Backend, due to time constraints.

For simple local execution, you will need to perform ```npm i``` in the cmd line in both the backend and frontend directories

You will need to generate your own Google API key, of which you can obtain for free as a student or with a free trial. The API key is to be placed in Map.jsx, below the block comment section. Once the site is deployed, 
this will no longer be of concern :)
